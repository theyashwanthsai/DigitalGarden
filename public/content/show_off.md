# On Seeking Attention

*Written on Jan 1, 2026*

There are two systems. 
### System A:
- I want to do things for myself
- I dont want to be performative
- I dislike shallow flexing

### System B:
- I want others to see this new thing I did and update their idea of my identity (this generally happens passively)
- Not sharing feels like a loss of value.

So, when you do something or find novel/cool/unusual and you feel the need to share it to the world, is that feeling bad? flexing?

Early humans had it rough in their society. Survival was also based on the social image and standing.

Novel actions implied bravery and competence. Sharing information increased tribe value, mating chances, and much more.

This is the whole base of the modern society we see. Social validation, status games.

Your world could be your parents, close circle of friends, etc. That urge to share it with your "world" is what made social apps big part of our lives and indirectly lead to creator/influencer economy.

Final note: 
- Is sharing needed for survival? No
- Is it needed for our psychological system inside us? Often, Yes.
