# Q-Learning

*My complete understanding of Q-Learning, written on 03 June 2025*



## Introduction: Teaching Machines to Make Smart Decisions

Imagine you're dropped into an unfamiliar city with no map, no GPS, just a simple goal: reach the central plaza. You'd probably start by wandering randomly, noting which streets lead to dead ends and which ones seem promising. Over time, you'd build a mental map of "good" and "bad" moves from each location.

This is exactly how Q-Learning works – it's an algorithm that teaches an agent to make optimal decisions through trial and error, building up knowledge about which actions work best in different situations.

This is not a new concept, we humans do it subconsciously all the time. After all, all these algorithms, this field of study itself is not born out of box, it is something we mimic from the nature. Thats what science is basically. Mimiccing the nature, around us.

## What is Q-Learning?

Q-Learning is a **model-free reinforcement learning algorithm** that learns the optimal action-selection policy for any given finite Markov decision process. In simpler terms:

- **Model-free**: The agent doesn't need to know the rules of the environment beforehand
- **Reinforcement learning**: It learns through rewards and punishments
- **Optimal policy**: It finds the best strategy to maximize long-term rewards

### The Q-Table

**Q-table** – a simple lookup table that stores the "quality" (Q-value) of taking each possible action from each possible state.

```
Q-Table Structure:
         Action 0  Action 1  Action 2  Action 3
State 0    [2.5]    [1.2]    [0.8]    [3.1]  ← Best action: 3
State 1    [4.2]    [5.7]    [2.1]    [1.9]  ← Best action: 1
State 2    [1.1]    [2.8]    [6.3]    [0.5]  ← Best action: 2
...
```

Higher Q-values indicate better actions. The agent simply picks the action with the highest Q-value for its current state.

## The Learning Algorithm: Step by Step

### 1. The Q-Learning Update Formula

The magic happens through this deceptively simple equation:

```
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ × max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
```

Where:
- **Q(s,a)**: Current Q-value for state s, action a
- **α (alpha)**: Learning rate (0-1) - how fast to learn
- **r**: Immediate reward received
- **γ (gamma)**: Discount factor (0-1) - how much to value future rewards
- **s'**: Next state after taking action a
- **max(Q(s',a'))**: Best possible Q-value from the next state

### 2. The Learning Process

1. **Start** in a state
2. **Choose** an action (balance exploration vs exploitation)
3. **Observe** the reward and new state
4. **Update** the Q-table using the formula above
5. **Repeat** until convergence

## Real Example: Grid World Navigation

Let's see Q-Learning in action with a concrete example. We'll build an agent that learns to navigate a 5×5 grid from start to goal while avoiding obstacles.

### The Environment Setup

```
Grid Layout:
S . . . .    S = Start (0,0)
. X . . .    G = Goal (4,4)  
. . X . .    X = Obstacles
. X . . .    . = Empty spaces
. . . . G
```

**Rewards:**
- Reach goal: +100
- Hit obstacle: -10  
- Each step: -1 (encourages efficiency)

## Some jargon:

### Some basic terms:
- **State**: The current situation the agent is in.
- **Action**: The action the agent can take.
- **Reward**: The reward the agent receives for taking an action.
- **Q-value**: The quality of taking an action from a state.
- **Step**: A single action taken by the agent.

### Episode 
Baically an **attempt** by the agent before it "dies". A single run of the agent.

##### Episode Lifecycle:
START → Take Actions → END CONDITION → RESET → Next Episode

##### 4 Ways an Episode Ends:

SUCCESS - Goal reached (position 4,4)
- **Episode ends immediately when agent reaches goal**
- Gets big reward (+100)
- This is what we want!


OBSTACLE - Hit a wall/obstacle
- **Episode ends the moment agent moves into obstacle**
- Gets penalty (-10)
- Agent learns "don't go there"


TIMEOUT - Too many steps (e.g., 200 steps)
- **Prevents agent from wandering forever**
- Episode ends even if goal not reached
- Big penalty for inefficiency


OUT OF BOUNDS - Tried to leave the grid
- **Episode ends when agent attempts invalid move**
- Gets penalty (-10)
- Agent learns grid boundaries


## Watching the Agent Learn
There are about 1000 episodes the agent is trained on. Heres what each episode looks like:

![alt text](/articleimages/episode.jpeg)

### Episode 1-100: Random Exploration
##### Early Q-table (mostly zeros)
```
State 0: [0.0, 0.1, -0.5, 0.2]  # Slight preferences emerging
State 5: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]   # No experience yet
```
The agent moves randomly (high epsilon = 0.9), bumping into walls and obstacles, slowly building initial Q-values.

### Episode 200-500: Pattern Recognition
##### Q-table developing structure
```
State 0: [2.1, 8.5, 1.2, 0.8]   # Clearly prefers action 1 (right)
State 1: [1.5, 9.2, 2.1, 4.1]   # Strong preference for right
State 5: [5.2, 7.8, 3.1, 2.9]   # Learning optimal moves
```

The agent starts finding the goal occasionally. Q-values begin reflecting the true value of actions.

### Episode 800-1000: Mastery
##### Converged Q-table
```
State 0: [42.6, 48.5, 36.2, 35.1]  # Right (48.5) is clearly best
State 1: [45.2, 54.9, 39.1, 42.6]  # Right (54.9) optimal
State 4: [52.1, 62.2, 45.8, 48.3]  # Right (62.2) leads to goal
```
**Final learned path**: Right → Right → Right → Right → Down → Down → Down → Down (8 steps, optimal!)

### The Learning Curve

![alt text](/articleimages/curve.jpeg)

Our training results show the classic Q-Learning progression:

```
Episode 100: Avg Reward = 16.8, Avg Steps = 40.2  (struggling)
Episode 300: Avg Reward = 88.2, Avg Steps = 11.2  (improving)
Episode 600: Avg Reward = 92.5, Avg Steps = 8.4   (nearly optimal)
Episode 1000: Avg Reward = 92.8, Avg Steps = 8.1  (mastered!)
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Exploration vs Exploitation (Epsilon-Greedy)

The agent faces a fundamental dilemma: should it try new actions (explore) or stick with what it knows works (exploit)?

**Epsilon-greedy strategy:**
```
if random() < epsilon:
    return random_action()  # Explore
else:
    return best_known_action()  # Exploit
```

- **High epsilon (0.9)**: Mostly random exploration
- **Low epsilon (0.1)**: Mostly exploitation with occasional exploration
- **Epsilon decay**: Start high, gradually reduce

### 2. Credit Assignment Problem

How does the agent know which actions led to the final reward? Q-Learning solves this through **temporal difference learning**:

```
Current estimate + Learning_rate × (Reality - Current estimate)
```

The "Reality" includes both immediate reward and discounted future value, allowing credit to propagate backward through the action sequence.

### 3. Convergence Guarantees

Q-Learning is guaranteed to converge to the optimal policy under these conditions:
- All state-action pairs are visited infinitely often
- Learning rate decreases appropriately over time
- The environment is stationary (rules don't change)

## Implementation Deep Dive

### The Complete Q-Learning Agent

```
class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, states=25, actions=4):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((states, actions))
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.randint(0, 3)  # Explore
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])  # Exploit

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        current_q = self.q_table[state, action]
        max_future_q = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])

        new_q = current_q + self.learning_rate * (
            reward + self.discount_factor * max_future_q - current_q
        )

        self.q_table[state, action] = new_q

    def decay_epsilon(self):
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay
```

### Training Loop
```
for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()

    while not done:
        action = agent.choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        agent.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state

    agent.decay_epsilon()
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Learning Rate (α)
- **Too high (0.9)**: Unstable learning, oscillations
- **Too low (0.01)**: Very slow convergence
- **Sweet spot (0.1-0.3)**: Steady, reliable learning

### Discount Factor (γ)
- **High (0.9-0.99)**: Values long-term rewards, strategic behavior
- **Low (0.1-0.5)**: Focuses on immediate rewards, myopic behavior

### Epsilon Decay
- **Fast decay**: Quick convergence but might miss optimal policy
- **Slow decay**: Thorough exploration but slower convergence

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths
- **Model-free**: No need to know environment dynamics
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Guaranteed convergence**: Under right conditions
- **Optimal**: Finds the best policy given enough time

### Limitations
- **Scalability**: Q-table grows exponentially with state space
- **Continuous spaces**: Can't handle continuous states/actions directly
- **Sample efficiency**: Needs many episodes to learn
- **Memory**: Stores Q-values for every state-action pair

## Whats next for my learning intelligence series?

### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
Replace the Q-table with a neural network to handle large state spaces:
Q(s,a) ≈ Neural_Network(s, a)

### Double Q-Learning
Use two Q-tables to reduce overestimation bias.

### Prioritized Experience Replay
Learn more from important experiences.

## Practical Applications

Q-Learning powers many real-world systems:

- **Game AI**: Chess, Go, video games
- **Robotics**: Navigation, manipulation
- **Trading**: Algorithmic trading strategies
- **Resource allocation**: Cloud computing, network routing
- **Recommendation systems**: Content personalization

## Conclusion: The Power of Learning from Experience

Q-Learning demonstrates a fundamental principle of intelligence: the ability to learn optimal behavior through trial and error. 
Our simple grid world agent went from random wandering to perfect navigation in just 1000 episodes, building up a complete understanding of its environment.

The beauty of Q-Learning lies in its simplicity and generality. The same algorithm that learned to navigate our 5×5 grid can learn to play chess, control robots, or optimize trading strategies. It just needs the right representation of states, actions, and rewards.

As we continue our reinforcement learning journey, remember that Q-Learning is just the foundation. Master these concepts, and we will be ready to tackle more advanced algorithms like Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients, and Actor-Critic methods.
