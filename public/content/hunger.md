# Develop Hunger

*Written on Oct 23, 2025*

Lately, I have been feeling this uneasyness throughout my body. Not physically, but mentally. Some part of me is not liking something. I am not sure what exactly it is, but I can sense it. That unknown feeling. 

Its a part of me telling me I am not doing what I am supposed to be doing. Its a reaction from my body towards my current mindset. I have become soft and lost the hunger.

Getting a job has made me soft. It was supposed to be. Because right from my childhood, everyone including my parents and teachers clearly made me work towards one goal: Job. A stable happy life, where you have a job, eventually leading a good status in society, and then a family, bla bla bla...

It took me a long time, but I am happy. I started working right from my final year in college. So even tho I only graduated 2 months ago, I have 1+ years of experience. 1+ years to finally have this self realization caused due to uneasyness in my mind. I finally realized that I had lost my drive and that I was simply indulging myself in useless pleasures.

I know many of you think we need those things as well. But I have a opinionated view on such takes. Social media, Movies and Shows. They eat most of our time. They give us dopamine which feels good. And we are stuck in this circle. Comfort zone. 

90% of the stuff we indulge ourselves, useless. If you think straight, these are man made things. We wont die if we dont consume them.

They are a trap.

I am gonna experiment. I will try to cut most of these things. I will regain my hunger. That drive to pull every single day. Put the hard work in the right direction.
