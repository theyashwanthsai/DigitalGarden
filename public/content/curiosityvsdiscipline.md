# Curiosity driven learning vs Discipline
*Written on Jan 11, 2026*


I let my curiosity lead me to do basically anything. I am not disciplined, but I am curious about things, and I have this (selfish) feeling of "owning" that thing. Owning basically means becoming decent at it, or creating something in that space, etc.

This is a pretty good way of living life according to me. As we grow old, our child like curiosity fades away as we get used to the world. Retaining that "childness" is important. That will lead you to better ideas and basically a colorful life.

Recently tho, I started seeing the downsides of it. I might have to inculcate some form of discipline. Jack of all trades is not a bad thing, but I often find myself starting something and leaving midway chasing something else. 

This cycle happened to me during my college days,  and at that time, I think its fine. Exploration doesnt come with a cost, since you have shitton of time and no worry to pay bills. Adulthood is scary and I cant jump from one to another because of these reasons:
1. Job takes away a good chunk of my time. Although my job is pretty chill and straightforward, and I do find a good chunk of time to grind, I dont want to keep doing the same thing. I want to go out, play a game, travel, talk to friends, play with my cat, spend time with parents and basically chill. I wanna do that 4/7 times. 
2. The freeeee time I have, I should be spending wisely. I shouldnt waste time in exploration, rather spend time in going deep.
3. Its common to burn out doing a lot of things at once, and I noticed the reason we burn out is often because our mind is cooked. Imagine a weak processor running 20 different applications. Decluttering your mind takes effort as well. Takes a lot of time.

Hence why, I want to sort of have a mix of curiosity driven exploration and discipline induced deep work sessions.
