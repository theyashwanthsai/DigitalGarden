Last year, I wrote a [small essay](./writing) on the importance of writing. I mentioned that I would want to relearn this skill even though it can be automated.

Writing is important because it can help in developing our brain thought process. The ability to articulate our raw thoughts such that anyone can understand the complete intent.

In that essay, I mentioned that one of my goals is to reach a lot of people and form meaningful connections. 1 year in, and I reached 120k people just from a single article (this also single handedly raked $3.6k. How cool is that)

### Let's recap my writing journey this year.
So I was writing since 2021, but only clearly started from the second half of 2024 and with clear intent from Dec 2024.

I was primarily writing articles related to the ai agents space, and in the month of Jan 2024, I had a total of 300k views on all the twitter articles. Heres a link which has a list of all articles.


While I was writing on twitter, I was also jotting down my thoughts on various other aspects such as [building in public](./buildinpublic), [ai vs art](./aivsart), [devlogs](./osdevlogs/root), etc.


In July, I realized I can write these articles on medium (thanks to my friend Mr Shaji to pointing it out). 2 months into medium, by september, I had my first break. I article I previously mentioned above. That opened a lot of doors, with a lot of freelance writing gigs to make some side income.


All in all, I have written a total of **26** articles in 2025, with a total of close to **400k** views across all platforms (**140k** in medium) and about **$5k** + in earnings which include medium payouts and sponsored posts.


I never imagined I would be earning money writing. That wasn't even my goal. I never searched "How to make money online writing" and all that. My essay on writing last year had something that I mentioned earlier, that writing can lead you to people and to opportunity you never knew existed. Thats like a side effect of writing and building in public in general. The main "effect" is the development of ourselves. Thats the most important. 

### What's ahead in 2026?
Apart from my my main job and research work I do at [Turilabs](https://turilabs.in), I want to focus on `Distribution`. In 2025, around April, I realized the importance of distribution first hand at an event I attended. Distribution is the only moat one can have in the future, and I think now is the best time to get started.

I would love to target long form and short form content, where my goal would be to establish an identity: of a researcher documenting his learnings on AI. Sort of a become a lens through which people can view my niche.
