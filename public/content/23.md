# 23
*Written on Jan 29, 2026*

I turned 23. The number feels a little serious this time. I never really cared about my birthdays, but turning 23 feels a bit… weird.

Seems like things are going to get real. It is a BIG number. This particular day reminds me of mr time that keeps running, not waiting for anyone or anybody.

I have decided to write few life lessons, so that I can look back someday and feel…. good ig. This is inspired by Daniel Bourke’s version, whom I have been following since 5 years now.

This year was great. I learnt new stuff, made money, bought things I always wanted, felt like I dominated the world, and then the dopamine fell, and I realized how small I am compared to the grand scale of our universe. I was at an all time high and my ego was inflated, but then I was pulled down, humbled really bad. I read a lot, wrote a lot. I had a massive transformation interms of my personality and character. Let me list 23 points I learn over the last 23 years.

## 1. No matter what the odds look like, always give everything you have got
There was a hackathon where we had to present our project, and I never thought we would even make it to the second stage of the competition, but we won. If i knew, I would have put more efforts. There was a blogpost I wrote which got generational views and money. If I knew this would have blown up, I would have put more efforts.

## 2. Knock on all the doors that are available, without hesitating or thinking too much
If you have 100 doors available to you, and you dont know whether these doors would open or not, Always go and knock on all 100 doors.

You never know which one will change your life.

## 3. Failmaxxing is the key
Dive in head first. Fear of failure can leave if you become used to being a failure. This gives you a lot of risk apetite compared to someone who is just used to winning and fears doing something new. Society is filled with people trying to be “perfect”, impressing their parents and friends. Be the opposite. Failmaxxing is truly the key.

## 4. Read like its prescribed your doctor
Brainrot is everywhere. Every organization is trying to get your attention. Stimulating content every where. There is a lack of information dense content to consume. Books are the only things that do this well. Habbit of reading will save you in the future.

## 5. Life is not a linear sprint bursts, but a non linear marathon, and a very long one
I have had this habbit of comparing with others at every stage of life. Glad that toxic mentality is gone. The path of life is different for everyone. One might be facing a downfall today, might ve the biggest thing in 5 years.

There is no incentive given to us to compare ourselves with others to know our growth/position in life. Society has made us believe this.

## 6. Clap for everyone, never be spiteful.
What kind of man are you if you cant clap when others have achieved something. You throw yourself in this dark hole, even though you could have lived in harmony. Spiteful behaviour has consumed you.

Clap for others, and when its your turn, everyone will clap for you. We are biologically wired to live in a social circle. You are not meant to live in a cave, grind it out to win in life.

## 7. Minimalism.
In mind, in life, in your house, in the plate in which you eat. Less is all you need.

## 8. Physically torture ur body, then reward it with the best you can
I joined mixed martial arts classes this year, and I learnt the real meaning of pushing past your limits. I have been training for almost 5 years, from home workouts in covid to gym sessions now. Training truly makes ur best version come out.

More than training, rest is what makes the actual difference. Food, Sleep, etc are super impotant.

## 9. Talk less about yourself and always listen others story
I have always had this habbit of talking about myself. This is actually something I identify as a toxic trait. Listen more, talk less.

## 10. Always think from within, not from the outside.
This is basically similar to first principles thinking. But along with thinking from scratch, It is also important we set the perspective of our thinking.

We all want a good life. A good life is all because of good decisions. Decisions originate from our own thoughts.

So improving the quality of yur thoughts is non negotiable. Again, reading and writing helps a lot.

## 11. You cant tame anger.
Its scientifically proven to raise cortisol. Peace can be practiced, but anger cant be tamed. Anger comes from attachment, which is why detachment is often described as the ultimate goal in life.

## 12. Writing is a habit that can help you change your life
Reading is just the first part of the story. Writing is second. Consistent writing has changed my life. Give it a try, stick with it for more than 6 months. Make it a habit, your qaulity of life will improve.

## 13. Build in public
My field allows me to build without investing in resources. Hence, I kept building for the last 4 years. I built, wrote about it, posted about it, and I have gotten opportunities solely because of the stuff I built, and stuff I learnt while building.

## 14. Systems > hard work.
You dont need to work hard. We have been psyoped to believe that. If you like a thing, ”grinding” will be as easy as butter. Passion and love are the most important things.

## 15. Pride is not needed.
Ego is super important. We all define ego incorrectly. Ego lets you attempt the unthinkable. You can produce magic out of think air, and you gotta believe that.

## 16. The greatest things are achieved by doing the simplest thing imaginable, over and over again.
Reading, writing, building, talking about the stuff you are working, stuff you built. You dont need to do anything different. Just the same thing again and again, till one blows off.

## 17. You cant do everything on your own
One of the best lessons I learnt this year was the power of delegation. Managing people, building systems around them to get your work done faster is something we arent normally taught in school or college (I did a btech in Computer Science)

## 18. You never step in the same river
Read a book again, build an idea again, watch a movie again. You will realize so much about your growth. These books or movies didnt change, it is you who changed, and it is important to notice and embrace that change.

## 19. Money is super important in life
But dont chase it, rather do something which makes it impossible to not come to you. I built a side income this year, and for the past 4–5 months, it has been super consistent. I did not aim for money, but it just followed.

## 20. Supplements
I used to think taking multiple supplements daily and keeping a list, and researching about them, etc etc is too extreme. But I realized the power of supplements. They make you a superhuman. Its not extreme, what is extreme is the adultry in all the foods around us.

## 21. Compounding is the 8th wonder of our world
Compounding is insane. Not just with money, but in every aspect of life. Repeat good habbits, and watch them compound.

## 22. Distribution is the MOAT
I am gonna invest time and money to build a personal brand this year. I absolutely dont see a reason not to do that. As an engineer, nothing hurts more than ur projects not get the traction it deserves. I aim to build a platform for everything I will build.

## 23. Lore needs to be maxxed
This year, I am going to travel a lot, meet new people, talk about stuff, get to know. Loremazzing awaits. I spent my whole life being an introvert, and somehow was convinced its not a problem. Well thats gonna change.

Well thats about it. Took me few hours to put all these here. Lets come back again in an year.
