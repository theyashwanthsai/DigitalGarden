# AI Agent Playbooks


I have been working on my book since a long time. Its a process which takes a lot of mental effort, along with a lot of time. But its fun. I thought sharing tid bits from the book on medium and my website would act as a feedback loop and improve my manuscript. So I have been sharing these since july. 

More than a feedback loop, this became a constant source of dopamine, and I am not complaining.

These playbooks are basically guides covering the whole book but in a more digestible format. The book will obviously have more content, but these are just enough to get you started tinkering with AI agents.
