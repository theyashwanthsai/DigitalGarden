I always believe in learning by building. Projects are what I have been building from the past 4 years. Here are a few of the projects I built while exploring various fields of interest.

This page is divided into 3 parts:
- Research: This is where I write about my research work.
- Hall of Fame: This is where I showcase my best work.
- Other Projects: This is where I showcase my old projects. These are probably very basic, but these are what made me who I am today.



## Research

## Projects
Learning is best when you build something around the knowledge. This is my motto.

### Hall of Fame:
These are the projects which I would show you if you want to know what my craft is all about.
If you're curious about the scope and quality of my work, these are the ones I would proudly present.
