Hi there! My name is Sai Yashwanth, I am an engineer and a writer. I love building stuff and writing about them online. I also like solving problems using tech. 


I recently got started as Head of AI at Vuhosi. I am building AI agents for the company.
I am currently writing a book on AI Agents which should be out in a few months. 

I recently discovered that I kind of like teaching. Sharing my knowledge with others. I aim to create content in my style and put it out there.

Currently working on:
- [Operating System](/osdevlogs/root): Building a toy operating system so that I can challenge myself outside of my comfort zone. Also because I got tired of python and wanted something raw.
- [Mastering Agentic AI](/my_book): A book on AI Agents, which I am writing with my Boss. This book will be in collaboration with [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/).
- [TuriLabs](https://turilabs.tech): An indie research lab. The plan is to collaborate with a bunch of corporate slaves (also my friends) and work on research oriented projects and write about them.

**Tech that I use:**

I [built a PC](/pcbuild) with my first stipend from an internship. I run pop os + windows on it. Heres a list of components I remember:
- Nvidia RTX4060
- Intel i5 12400f
- Benq 27inch Monitor (Primary monitor)
- Acer ED270R 27 Inch Curved LCD (Secondary monitor)
- Macbook Air 2017: I used it during my college. This machine is so close to my heart. I dont use it now tho.
