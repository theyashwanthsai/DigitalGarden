## Looking for Mentorship

I'm at a point where I want to dive deeper into actual research. Right now, my day job involves building AI applications, but I'm more drawn to the foundational stuff: training systems, RL environments, and how models actually learn and interact with complex worlds. 

The work I'm most excited about these days involves environments and reinforcement learning. I started Turilabs partly because I wanted to explore these areas more seriously. There's something fascinating about creating worlds where AI systems can learn and evolve, rather than just processing text or generating responses.

I learn best when I'm thrown into the deep end. Give me a hard problem, let me struggle with it, ask stupid questions, and eventually figure it out. I've always been someone who learns by building and breaking things. If you're working on interesting research and could use an extra pair of hands (and eyes) on the problem, I'd be interested in hearing about it.

**Some things about me:**
- Co-authored a paper for NeurIPS Workshop 2025 on Pokemon LLM benchmarking ([repo](https://github.com/Turi-Labs/Poke-Bench))
- Writing a book on AI Agents with Manning Publications
- Started Turilabs, an indie ai research lab to pursue research-driven projects beyond my day job. As we approach our first anniversary, we’ve completed 5 research projects with one accepted at NeurIPS 2025 and four nearing publication. Along the way, I’ve built a close, diverse community of collaborators ranging from first-year students to a 65-year-old veteran exploring reinforcement learning.
- Published and presented 3 research papers at 10th international and above conferences.
- More: [Proof of work](./timeline)
