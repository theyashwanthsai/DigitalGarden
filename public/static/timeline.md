## Timeline
I started documenting my life right after I started college. I was writing blogs, and was active in the tech part of twitter. This page reflects my journey into CS, and understanding life as well. Its chronological, should read bottom-up. I will be updating it as I go along!

- Secon research paper of turilabs was completed. This was a complete math heavy research paper. [Link]()

- Was still exploring game dev but eventually gave up.

### 2021
- Started learning python seriously and building projects with it. 
- Took part in my first hackathon and learnt a lot.
