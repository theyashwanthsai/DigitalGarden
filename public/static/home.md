# Sai Yashwanth

Welcome to my personal website. I am Sai Yashwanth, an engineer, builder and a writer. Here's my [cv](./resume)

I currently work as an AI Engineer at [StartupFuel](https://startupfuel.com) where I build AI agents and post-train language models.

I document events of my life [here](./timeline). Take your time and check it out to know more about me. I run an indie ai research lab called [Turi Labs](https://www.turilabs.in)

Meet my cat.

I love building stuff, writing, reading, playing football and working out. I believe in the idea of becoming "multidimensionally jacked". Body, mind, knowledge, skills, communication, finance and most important: personality. The idea is to max out all aspects of life. But the goal is to live peacefully and happily with family, friends and loved ones.

Although I am very lazy and sometimes lack the motivation or the urge to take actions, I am actively trying to fix my life in this regard.
Check this out to find out more about my experiments with productivity and time management (Coming soon) 


### Map
This is how I organize this space. I will be honest, most of the stuff here is a "work in progress". This space will keep changing (this website was completely different back in 2023). To me, this space is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). It is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, projects, and experiences. Here's a map of the space:

- [Essays](./articles): I got this habbit of writing and I love it. Here's a collection of all the stuff I have written.
- [Projects](./projects): A showcase of all the projects I have worked on. (Might be incomplete)
- [Timeline](./timeline): A chronological view of my journey, achievements, and experiences.
- [Reading List (wip)](./reading-list): A compilation of books, articles, and papers that I have read or plan to read.


## A typical day in my life
Apart from work, I try to follow this routine (average day):

- Training: Currently taking mma classes + calisthenics. Left lifting weights after 4 years of doing so.
- Eating: Eat clean (high protein, less carbs, more healthy fats). Atleast 90% of the time.
- Reading: Read papers, blogs mostly related to the work I do and get paid for. I am currently reading [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.](https://navalmanack.com/)
- Writing: Practice writing daily (or atleast often).
- Hacking: Work on side research projects.

I also love playing games. I am currently grinding arc raiders with my friends. Few of my favorite titles: [Ghost of Tsushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima), [Uncharted 4.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End), [Rdr2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
