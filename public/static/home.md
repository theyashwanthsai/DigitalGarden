# Sai Yashwanth

Welcome to my personal website. I am Sai Yashwanth, an engineer, builder and a writer. 
I am currently working as the Head of AI at Vuhosi, leading the development of ai agents and automation workflows. Here's my [cv](./resume)

Want to know me better? Check my chronologically ordered [proof of work.](./timeline) This is basically a timeline of my work, achievements, and experiences over the years.

I run an indie ai research lab called [Turi Labs.](https://www.turilabs.in)

I love building stuff, writing, reading, playing football and working out. I believe in the idea of becoming "multidimensionally jacked" - body, mind, knowledge, skills, communication, finance. The idea is to max out all aspects of life.

Although I am very lazy and sometimes lack the motivation or the urge to take actions, I am actively trying to fix my life in this regard. I will write about my experiments and observations fixing my body and mind soon. 

## Looking for Mentorship

I'm at a point where I want to dive deeper into actual research. Right now, my day job involves building AI applications, but I'm more drawn to the foundational stuff: training systems, RL environments, and how models actually learn and interact with complex worlds. 

The work I'm most excited about these days involves environments and reinforcement learning. I started Turilabs partly because I wanted to explore these areas more seriously. There's something fascinating about creating worlds where AI systems can learn and evolve, rather than just processing text or generating responses.

I learn best when I'm thrown into the deep end. Give me a hard problem, let me struggle with it, ask stupid questions, and eventually figure it out. I've always been someone who learns by building and breaking things. If you're working on interesting research and could use an extra pair of hands (and eyes) on the problem, I'd be interested in hearing about it.

**Some things about me:**
- Co-authored a paper for NeurIPS Workshop 2025 on Pokemon LLM benchmarking ([repo](https://github.com/Turi-Labs/Poke-Bench))
- Writing a book on AI Agents with Manning Publications
- Started Turilabs, an indie ai research lab to pursue research-driven projects beyond my day job. As we approach our first anniversary, we’ve completed 5 research projects with one accepted at NeurIPS 2025 and four nearing publication. Along the way, I’ve built a close, diverse community of collaborators ranging from first-year students to a 65-year-old veteran exploring reinforcement learning.
- Published and presented 3 research papers at 10th international and above conferences.
- More: [Proof of work](./timeline)

### Map
This is how I organize this space. I will be honest, most of the stuff here is a "work in progress". This space will keep changing (this website was completely different back in 2023). To me, this space is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). It is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, projects, and experiences. Here's a map of the space:

- [Essays](./articles): I got this habbit of writing and I love it. Here's a collection of all the stuff I have written.
- [Projects](./projects): A showcase of all the projects I have worked on. (Might be incomplete)
- [Timeline](./timeline): A chronological view of my journey, achievements, and experiences.
- [Reading List (wip)](./reading-list): A compilation of books, articles, and papers that I have read or plan to read.


## A typical day in my life
Apart from work, I try to follow this routine (average day):

- Training: Currently taking mma classes + calisthenics. Left lifting weights after 4 years of doing so.
- Eating: Eat clean (high protein, less carbs, more healthy fats). Atleast 90% of the time.
- Reading: Read papers, blogs mostly related to the work I do and get paid for. I am currently reading [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.](https://navalmanack.com/)
- Writing: Practice writing daily (or atleast often).
- Hacking: Work on side research projects.

I also love playing games. Few of my favorite titles: [Ghost of Tsushima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Tsushima), [Uncharted 4.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End), [Rdr2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2)
